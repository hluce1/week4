Good afternoon Mark, 

Hope you enjoyed your leave?

I’m just informing you that the project work finishes up this week. 

We are happy to start handover arrangements of our materials, we have a public repository of the project work and code.

We can send that through to you and there is also a video attached to this email (zip file, 21MB), demoing the app.

The demo shows how users will download the app on their device which can then access the document online and offline. 

If you have something else in mind for handover, or would like more detail about the app, please let us know.

There is also a sponsor sign off sheet attached, we’d appreciate if you could fill that in and sign off at your earliest convenience.

Thanks and kind regards,
Harry Lucey
